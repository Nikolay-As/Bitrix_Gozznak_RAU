	From April 28 to November 29, 2017 in the House of Stock Capital on the territory of the Peter and Paul Fortress worked the exhibition "From kerenka to Sovznanka: Money and Revolution".
</p>
<p>
The exhibition was prepared by Goznak JSC and dedicated to money circulation in Russia in 1914 - 1922 - that is, from the beginning of the First World War to the beginning of the New Economic Policy.
</p>
<p>
By the beginning of the First World War, Russian banknotes were freely exchanged for gold coins. By 1917, only paper money was used in everyday life, which was gradually devalued. By the beginning of the 1920s, the volume of unsecured paper money reached such a size that it was more profitable to heat the stove with banknotes than to buy firewood from them. Between 1921 and 1922, the account was already worth millions and billions.
</p>
<p>
The exhibition "From kerenki to Sovznak: Money and Revolution" presented unique items from the funds of Goznak JSC, many of which were first shown to the general public.
</p>
<p>
Among the exhibits were: money stamps; the first "kerenkf", approved in September 1917 by the Minister of Finance of the Provisional Government, Mikhail Vladimirovich Bernatsky; the project of Soviet money with a portrait of Karl Marx; the first national money with Soviet symbols - "settlement signs"; the project of "golden hryvnia" - an unfinished version of chervonets; the first Soviet coins.
</p>
<p>
Visitors of the exhibition could learn how the image of swastika appeared on the credit tickets issued in 1917 by the Provisional Government.
</p>
<p>
A separate section of the exhibition is devoted to the moneymaking of the Civil War, when the local "white" and "red" authorities, the boards of consumer societies and shop owners printed their own money.
</p>
<p>
On the territory of the former Russian Empire at that time, according to experts, about 20 thousand different types of money were circulating. Some of them - in particular, the money of the Khorezm People's Soviet Republic, printed on silk; the money of the Semirechye, provided with opium; the check of the natural settlement union "Sense and Conscience" - were presented at the exhibition.
