<p>
	Dear visitors!
</p>
<p>
	To make a visit to the Museum of Money History always a joy for all our guests, we ask you to observe a few simple rules:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		do not enter the exposition area with bulky things (bags, backpacks, etc.). Such things can be left in a wardrobe or a storage room;
	</li>
	<li>
		no weapons or explosives of any kind may be brought into the Exposition area;
	</li>
	<li>
		we will not be able to allow you on display with ice cream and other foodstuffs or with any drinks;
	</li>
	<li>
		unfortunately, there are no conditions on the Exposition's territory that would allow us to accept visitors with animals (except for guide dogs);
	</li>
	<li>
		free photo and video shooting without using a flash is allowed in the museum halls;
	</li>
	<li>
		disabled visitors using wheelchairs can move freely on the first floor of the museum, observing safety measures. Visitors with disabilities may contact the hall administrator or any other museum staff for assistance;
	</li>
	<li>
		a strong request is that children should not be left unattended.
	</li>
</ul>
