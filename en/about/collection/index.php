</p>
<p>
	Until the middle of the 17th century ruble was neither a coin but a unit of weight and account.
	Only in 1654 a coin with a name of ruble was minted during the reign of Aleksey Romanov (father of Peter the Great).
	It was remade out of thaler – European silver coin. Thalers were wide spread in Russia since 16th century. Only 40 original coins are known today.

</p>
<p>
	Peter the Great had finally reformed Russian monetary system in the beginning of the 18th century.
	He was the first Russian tsar ( in 1721 got the title of emperor) who ever left Russia and travelled abroad.
	He was looking for new modern technologies. He had been to the London mint and probably met the headquarters of it – Isaac Newton.
	Coins got the proper round shape and edge. He totally updated mint manufacturing.
	Manual coinage was left behind by mechanical one. The foundation of St.Petersburg Mint on the territory of Peter and Paul fortress in 1724 was a breakthrough in coin production.
	St.Pb. Mint was supplied with up to date equipment and very soon turned to be one of the best in Europe. It is considered to be the oldest enterprise of Goznak.
	Ruble of 1724 is one of the first minted in Peter and Paul fortress.
